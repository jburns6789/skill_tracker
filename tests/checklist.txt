Testing Checklist

Verify CORS blocks requests from unauthorized domains

Test CSRF token requirement on POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints

Confirm invalid inputs (e.g., emails without "@") are rejected

Check SQL injection attempts are blocked by ORM/schema validation

Your backend will now meet modern security standards for CORS, CSRF, and input validation.
